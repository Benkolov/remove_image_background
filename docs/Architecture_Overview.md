# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The Background Remover application follows a modular architecture with three main components:

```
+-------------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
|   main.py   | --> |  gui.py   | --> |  sors.py  |
| (Entry Point|     |(GUI Layer)|     |(Processing|
|            )|     |          )|     |  Layer)   |
+-------------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
                         |                  |
                         v                  v
                  +--------------+   +--------------+
                  |   Tkinter    |   |    rembg     |
                  | (GUI Library)|   |   Library    |
                  +--------------+   +--------------+
```

## Component Overview

### 1. Entry Point (main.py)
- Serves as the application's entry point
- Initializes the GUI application
- Minimal code footprint, focusing on application bootstrapping
- Imports and calls the main GUI function

### 2. GUI Layer (gui.py)
- Implements the graphical user interface using Tkinter
- Manages user interactions and event handling
- Key features:
  - Image selection and display
  - Background removal triggering
  - Processed image preview
  - Save functionality
  - Status updates
- Class structure:
  - BackgroundRemoverGUI class handling all UI components
  - Organized methods for each functionality

### 3. Processing Layer (sors.py)
- Handles core image processing functionality
- Implements background removal logic
- Features:
  - Image processing using rembg library
  - Error handling and logging
  - Command-line interface support
  - File handling and validation

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter for GUI
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image handling
- rembg for background removal
- logging for application logging
- pathlib for file path management

### Data Flow
1. User selects image through GUI
2. GUI passes image to processing layer
3. Processing layer removes background
4. Processed image returned to GUI
5. User can preview and save result

## Design Patterns
- MVC-like separation of concerns
- Event-driven architecture for GUI
- Error handling with proper logging
- Command pattern for processing operations

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive error catching in processing layer
- User-friendly error messages in GUI
- Logging system for debugging and monitoring
- Graceful failure handling

## Future Extensibility
- Modular design allows for easy feature additions
- Clear separation of concerns enables component updates
- Well-defined interfaces between layers
